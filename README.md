## Kat's Portfolio Site

Hey you!

So this is gonna be your new site. This is where the code will live that needs to be built and shipped to 
wherever hosts http://kathrynsummers.co.uk

### `What you can do`

Nothing basically, this is for you to just look at as I slowly add to it. I might ask you to contribute
some assets or images for the site, but that's a ways off yet

### `What this is written in`

- Javascript
- ReactJs
- more to follow as I make some more tech choices

### `Theme`
